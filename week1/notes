1. we run a docker container, get in the running container -> install or add or update something in the running container -> then exit (the container stop) -> run the container again -> all changes we made is gone. the container back to the initial state where an image is built.
    this is one the advantage of using container, changes we made like bad things will not affected when we restart the container.
    also, it's isolated. we install postgres db on container will not affect to the postgres db local at all.
    also, container package every environment setup we need for our app. so, if it's running on our machine, it will also run on other's machine.
    also, container is used for GCP kube, AWS batch.
